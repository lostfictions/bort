- batch writes resulting from reducer application instead of applying them
  immediately (which is still async anyway)

- remove immutable!

- low-hanging optimizations for level: namespace wordbank and only write changed
  keys, etc.

- allow normalizing differences between clients
  - normalized username format (for "seen" command, etc.)
  - (maybe) service-independent formatting (markdown -> whatever?)

- reminder command

----------------------------------------------------

- cleanup messages? (eg. confirmations will disappear after 10 seconds; poor
  man's emulation of slack bot messages only visible to the user who invoked the
  command)

- undo!

---------------------------------------------------------------

- dynamically import command list; make configurable via env vars
- allow commands to be automatically disabled if eg. api keys are missing

- document commands usage

- reinstate radio command for discord
